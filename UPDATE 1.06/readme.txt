! This update required some changes in the /css/style.css,
  as well as /js/main.js if you have not changed the
  style.css file then just copy the /css floder along with /js folder and paste
  them in your root folder. only the updated files are included. but if you have
  already made changes to the style.css and do not want to overwrite it with this
  updated /css/style.css file then we've prepaerd an addition css file which you
  can find in the root folder here under the name of: CSS_update1.06.css

* There is no addition JavaScript file so you have to use the updated version.

* We have added a new demo pages: background slideshow and background youtube video .
